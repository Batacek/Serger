<h1>What is it for?</h1>
<i>Do you have some sort of server and you're worried about its availability? For example, do you have a website and you're worried that your visitors won't be able to visit it?</i>
<b>This thing is for you!</b><br>
This program will notify you if there are any troubles with your server. Right now it can only check if the server is reachable, but soon it will be able to check a lot more and get a lot more details for you.

<h1>Current features</h1>

- You can change the ping delay (default: 10 000ms/10s)
- You can choose between 2 languages (Czech and English)
    - You can easily translate it to another language or even enter your own messages
- You can ping any type of server

<h1>GUI</h1>
Right now the GUI is under development and will be released with version Beta 0.3.0. The first stable GUI release will be version 1.0.0.
<br>
The GUI will be made in MAUI and will be available for Windows and MacOS. Linux support will be without GUI but we plan to include WPF app for Linux. MAUI supports Android and iOS, but We don't plan to make a mobile app in the near future.
<br>
The GUI will soon include Windows notifications and tray icon features.
